        <h1>Slavery</h1>
        <p>At THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE</p>
        <p>BY THE REV. WILLIAM WRIGHT, M. A. OF TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN</p>
    </header>
    
    <article>
        <h2>PREFACE</h2>
        <p>The following notes are written at the request of some kind and amiable friends, whom I find difficulty in refusing, from the reasons which they urged. I was represented to me that the peculiar opportunities which my professional employment gave me of observing the state of slavery.</p>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>THE horrors of the unnatural and debasing system which forms the subject of the present publication have of late years been so completely exposed and so faithfully depicted by many able and well-informed writers that it will be the less necessary on the present occasion to enter into any general views on the subject. Mine is the more humble task of detailing such facts in illustration of the effects of the system as have incidentally presented themselves during my residence in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, and of reviewing the progress of legislative improvement within that period, which I have watched with so small degree of interest.</p>

        <h2>RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION</h2>
        <p>ALTHOUGH religious instruction forms no part of the last Consolidated Order, yet it naturally presents itself to the mind of the Christian as the first subject for consideration. Its nature, progress, and extent must be a subject of interest to many; and it shall be my endeavour to give, if not in all respects a pleasing, yet I trust an impartial, account of these.</p>

        <h2>SUNDAY MARKETS - OBSERVATION OF THE LORD'S DAY</h2>
        <p>This section describes the methodology used in the research, including the design, data collection, and analysis procedures.</p>

        <h2>PRIZE NEGROES</h2>
        <p>Having alluded in the preceding pages to the prize negroes, I take this opportunity of stating that I should have entered more fully into their case, had not my pages been exclusively devoted to that of the slaves.</p>

        <h2>PUNISHMENTS</h2>
        <p>Mr. Miller thus forcibly depicts the further inefficacy of protecting laws for the slave. “Distant, perhaps, fifty miles from the nearest civil authority, how can he enter his complaint? And if he do, and punishment is awarded to the master, it were better for him that he had never been born. Alas! may he not now be sacrificed in a thousand ways that the law can take no notice of? For those who have seen the system working know full well that this is an offence which is never overlooked. He is now subject to every species of misery. His very companions abandon him—for sympathy in his wretchedness may be visited with the lash, and deserted by all - he pines till death release him.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This addendum explains the structural choices made in encoding the academic paper into HTML.</p>

        <h3>Font Choices</h3>
        <p>The font used throughout the document is Arial, a sans-serif font known for its readability.</p>

        <h3>Heading Sizes</h3>
        <p>The main title (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) has a font size of 2.5em, section titles (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) are 1.8em, and subsection titles (<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) are 1.4em. The main text (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) is set to 1em.</p>

        <h3>Color Choices</h3>
        <p>Background color for the body is #eef2f3, header color is #0077cc, section titles are #004080, and the text color is #333.</p>

        <h3>Margin and Padding Choices</h3>
        <p>The overall margin for the body is 20px, with a margin of 30px for the header. Sections and paragraphs have a margin-bottom of 20px and 15px, respectively. Padding is applied uniformly with 15px in section containers and the header.</p>

        <h3>Semantic HTML Choices</h3>
        <p>Ensured proper use of heading levels: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for section titles, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for subsections, reflecting the hierarchical structure of the content.</p>
        
        <p>This project eliminates any instances where visual appearance influenced the choice of HTML elements, ensuring all elements are semantically appropriate.</p>
